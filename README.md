# Bon Jisho

A free Japanese dictionary based on electron.

(This app is still under initial development)

## Development

Currently, the app is only supported on mac.

### Building the Database

Before compiling the app, we need to build the database.
This project uses [Japanese DB Maker](https://github.com/ezhmd/japanese-db). 

1. Put all the required materials (JMdict_e, JMnedict.xml, etc) inside `db-src` folder.

1. Run following script:
    ```sh
    npm run db-build
    ```

### Watch

1. Open two separate terminal windows.

2. Run following commands:

    ```sh
    # Terminal 1
    # This command will watch Angular code changes
    yarn ng-start 

    # Terminal 2
    # This command will start Electron Webpack
    yarn dev
    ```

## Building

To build and package a single executable app, run following command:

```sh
# Build Database
yarn db-build

# Build Preload Asar
npx asar pack ./src/preload ./static/pre.asar

# Build Angular Asar
ng build --configuration="production"
npx asar pack ./static/ng-dist ./static/ng.asar
rm -rf ./static/ng-dist

# Build Angular App
yarn dist
```
